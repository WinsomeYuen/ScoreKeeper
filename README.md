# ScoreKeeper

## Android Basics: Uder Input
App that allows a user to keep track of points within a game. In the most recent portion of the udacity course, I learnt how to 
make use of Java in your Android apps to make them interactive. With Score Keeper, I will be practicing this skill set, with particular 
focus on button code, variable scope, and updating views.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

*Adding button code to your app
*Updating views
*Properly scoping variables
*Finding views by their ID
